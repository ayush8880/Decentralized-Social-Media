Decentralized Social Media using Lens Protocol


In blockchain, decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decisionmaking from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to
a distributed network. Decentralized networks strive to reduce the level of trust
that participants must place in one another, and deter their ability to exert
authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the functionality of
the network.
Decentralization is not a new concept. When building a technology solution,
three primary network architectures are typically considered: centralized,
distributed, and decentralized. While blockchain technologies often make use of
decentralized networks, a blockchain application itself cannot be categorized
simply as being decentralized or not. Rather, decentralization is a sliding scale
and should be applied to all aspects of a blockchain application. By
decentralizing the management of and access to resources in an application,
greater and fairer service can be achieved. Decentralization typically has some
tradeoffs such as lower transaction throughput, but ideally, the tradeoffs are
worth the improved stability and service levels they produce.
Decentralized social media networks also work differently compared to their
centralized counterparts. Centralized social networks consist of standalone
websites where users can only interact with other users on the same website. For
example, users on Reddit can only send or receive messages from other Reddit
users and cannot directly interact with Twitter users.
In contrast, a decentralized social network is a collection of interconnected
communities (also called a “fediverse”) where each community owns an instance
of the code. Each community can also have its own set of rules, with some
communities choosing to open membership registration to the public while
others operate more privately. On decentralized social media networks, users can
communicate with other users in any community, provided they choose to be
public.
